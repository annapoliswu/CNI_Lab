For this purpose, I developed a module showing ECE’s critical role in neuroimaging technology and analysis for their enrichment program during their enrichment hour (4-5 pm on Wednesday).</description></item><item><title>Neural Decoding with Kernel-based Metric Learning</title><link>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/research/neural_decoding/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 23:19:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/research/neural_decoding/</guid><description>Overview When studying the nervous system, the choice of metric for the neural responses is a pivotal assumption. A well-suited distance metric enables neuroscientists to gauge the similarity of neural responses to various stimuli and assess the variability of responses to a repeated stimulus. In particular, neural spike train metrics have been used to quantify the information content carried by the timing of action potentials. While a number of metrics for individual neurons exist, a method to optimally combine single-neuron metrics into multi-neuron, or population-based, metrics is lacking.</description></item><item><title>Learning Recurrent Waveforms within EEGs</title><link>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/research/eegs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 22:42:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/research/eegs/</guid><description>Overview When experts analyze EEGs they look for landmarks in the traces corresponding to established patterns such as oscillatory and phasic events of particular frequency or morphology. Long records motivate automated analysis techniques. Automation techniques often require design choices such as wavelet family or number of bandpass filters. To overcome this, we explore a modeling approach that automatically learns recurrent temporal waveforms within EEG traces. The estimation is based on a multiple-input, single-output linear model with sparsely excited inputs.</description></item><item><title>M.B.A</title><link>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/past/edwinsalcedo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 17:36:38 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/past/edwinsalcedo/</guid><description>Machine learning for semisupervised domain transfer.</description></item><item><title>M.S.</title><link>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/current/hauphan/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 17:00:52 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/current/hauphan/</guid><description>Reinforcement learning estimation and detection.</description></item><item><title>M.S.</title><link>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/current/hassanbaker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 17:00:38 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/current/hassanbaker/</guid><description>Neural decoding and signal processing.</description></item><item><title>M.S.</title><link>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/current/bilalriaz/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 17:00:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/current/bilalriaz/</guid><description>Unsupervised learning as optimizations with positive semidefinite matrices.</description></item><item><title>M.S.</title><link>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/current/cesarolivares/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 17:00:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/current/cesarolivares/</guid><description>Vigilant machine learning.</description></item><item><title>M.S.</title><link>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/current/yukselkarahan/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 16:59:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/current/yukselkarahan/</guid><description>Data science techniques for semisupervised domain transfer.</description></item><item><title>M.S.</title><link>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/current/carloscardenas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 13:12:57 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/current/carloscardenas/</guid><description>Works with spotting brain wave patterns using neural networks.</description></item><item><title>Admissions</title><link>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/singles/admissions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 12:49:16 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/singles/admissions/</guid><description>I will be accepting graduate students beginning with the 2020–2021 academic year and continuing through subsequent semesters. In exceptional situations, support may be available starting in the summer before the fall term.
Due to the fact that I may miss your email, please apply to the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and designate me as a potential advisor. I may also be able to advise students in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences (CIS): please designate me as a potential advisor.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/singles/contact/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 12:49:01 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/singles/contact/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Quantifying the informativeness of similarity measurements</title><link>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/research/informativeness/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2021 21:25:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/research/informativeness/</guid><description>Overview Choosing the particulars of a data representation is crucial for the successful application of machine learning techniques. In the unsupervised case, there is a lack of measures that can be used to compare different parameter choices that affect the representation. In this paper, we describe an unsupervised measure for quantifying the &amp;lsquo;informativeness&amp;rsquo; of correlation matrices formed from the pairwise similarities or relationships among data instances.
The measure quantifies the heterogeneity of the correlations and is defined as the distance between a correlation matrix and the nearest correlation matrix with constant off-diagonal entries.</description></item><item><title>Some Title</title><link>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/current/andrewbrockmeier/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Apr 2018 17:07:03 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/members/current/andrewbrockmeier/</guid><description>I am an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and the Department of Computer and Information Sciences (CIS) within the College of Engineering at the University of Delaware (UD), and a resident faculty in UD&amp;rsquo;s Data Science Institute.
