In exceptional situations, support may be available starting in the summer before the fall term.
Due to the fact that I may miss your email, please apply to the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and designate me as a potential advisor. I may also be able to advise students in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences (CIS): please designate me as a potential advisor.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/singles/contact/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 12:49:01 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://annapoliswu.github.io/CNI_Lab/singles/contact/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
