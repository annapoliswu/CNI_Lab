I am an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and the Department of Computer and Information Sciences (CIS) within the College of Engineering at the University of Delaware (UD), and a resident faculty in UD's Data Science Institute.

My research interests include data science, machine learning, signal processing, and the underlying mathematics and design of statistical models, optimizations, and algorithms. I have experience interfacing with complex data from the domains of biomedical engineering, neuroscience, and natural language processing.
