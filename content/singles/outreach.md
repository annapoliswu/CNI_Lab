In 2019, I took part in a Women in Engineering organized outreach event at a local New Castle Middle School, [Serviam Girls Academy](https://serviamgirlsacademy.org/) , whose mission is to take girls from low-income houses and give them the education they need to succeed in high school and beyond. For this purpose, I developed a module showing ECE’s critical role in neuroimaging technology and analysis for their enrichment program during their enrichment hour (4-5 pm on Wednesday). Working with ECE undergraduate student (Trevor Foresta) and a post-doctoral research Julia Schneider from the Department of Linguistics and Cognitive Sciences. Trevor assembled and tested the OpenBCI headset.

In 2020, I volunteered and hosted a lunchtime activity booth at the “Engineering Your Tomorrow” event held at Delaware Tech Community College in Georgetown, DE.  The Sussex County STEM Alliance organized this outreach event with the purpose “to expose, mentor and teach our County’s diverse young girls the basic fundamentals of science and engineering through high interest STEM activities, while showing them... "STEM IS FUN".  After helping with the entomology experiments in the morning, I set up the booth that showcased ECE’s critical role in biomedical engineering with a live demonstration and interactive handouts. For this event, I worked with ECE undergraduate student (Trevor Foresta). Trevor had previously assembled and tested the OpenBCI headset.
